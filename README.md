This repository is a landing page for a crowd funding campaign to make [Silex free website builder](http://www.silex.me) better.It is a vailable at http://crowdfunding.silex.me and hosted for free by github with [gihub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The HTML page ```index.html``` is generated by Silex, ready for deployment.

The HTML page ```editable.html``` is the "source" HTML file, editable in Silex itself. This page is made without programming, just drag and drop, with [Silex, live web creation](http://www.silex.me/). Feel free to fork this repository and contribute improvments.
